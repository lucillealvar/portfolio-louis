    "description": "Dead Matter is a rogue-lite zombie survival game currently in early access and developed by Quantum Integrity Software Inc. The game was originally created and released as a mod for Crysis 2 back in 2012. After moving on Unreal Engine, they launched an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign in 2018 that gathered more than 1.3 millions dollars. \nUnfortunately, lacking of real structure and experimented developers, the studio struggled in its production. I was hired as Gameplay System Designer in march 2022, as only real Game Designer in the crew to try to give a second breath to the project. ",
