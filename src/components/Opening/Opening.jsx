      <h2>Welcome to Louis Langlet's Portfolio</h2>
      <p>
        I am a creative professional with 3 years
        professional game industry experience as <strong>Game Designer</strong>{" "}
        . I graduated as valedictorian from Isart Digital Montr√©al in 2021,

      <p>
        I focus mainly on gameplay systems and interactions wrapped with great
        narrative. I also build and script levels with Unreal Engine that has
        become one of my greatest crafting tools, especially with blueprints.
